  "option_template_description":"The Digital Gatekeeper was developed using the game engine Gamemaker Studio 2. The features of the prototype were programmed using Game Maker Language, Gamemakerâ€™s coding language. \r\n\r\nThe core gameplay mechanics include interacting with the game interface and verifying choices. When starting a new game, the player is presented with the following: screens that display information about a news article, a book containing Media and Internet Literacy guidelines, and two buttons one -- for approving the article and one for rejecting the article. The goal of which is to figure out which articles presented are filled with misinformation and which are truthful. In total, there are three days of gameplay with five articles to examine each day. The number of articles and days are subject to change as the game is still a prototype. Each day, the book of commandments decays, encouraging players to remember the rules.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the game, the player gets to see the result of their choices. Having a total number of correct answers greater than ten makes the player win the game. Otherwise, it will be a loss, and the game starts again from the beginning. \r\n",
